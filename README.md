# Impulse
Impulse is a rhythm game where the player must click on the circles that appear on the screen to the beat of the song. Players can play procedurally generated beatmaps using their own audio files.
The beatmaps are automatically generated using superflux onset detection, and Perlin Noise for x and y coordinates.
